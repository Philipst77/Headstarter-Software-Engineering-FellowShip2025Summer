## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Intelligent Agents**  
  Specialized AI agents tackle different parts of the ML lifecycle â€” from problem framing to model suggestions and code prototyping.

- **Autonomous Collaboration**  
  Each agent handles a unique role, and together they form a coordinated crew that builds context and completes tasks intelligently.

- **Custom CSV Input**  
  Upload a `.csv` file to allow the assistant to inspect your dataset and tailor its guidance and code suggestions based on real data.

- **Markdown Code Output**
